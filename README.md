# How to install?
Just download the zip file by clicking

# What do I do now?
1. i recommend you to not mess with [`index.html`](./index.html). <br>
if you want to, you can modify the html and create your own sorting algorithm. breaking the file will not be my responsibility, beginners!

2. instead, go to [this part of index.html](./index.html#L91-L97).<br> dont change the name of the setting or my script cant read it.

# How can I use the [settings](./index.html#L91-L97)?
You can change this file with my website [JSONViewer](https://alatomking.github.io/JSONViewer/). As for now, it's still on development. You can't modify files yet, just viewing it.

### [Array Size:](./index.html#L92) <br>
How many arrays you want

### [Delay Milliseconds:](./index.html#L93) <br>
How long you want to wait

### [Repeat?:](./index.html#L94) <br>
After the sorting is done, would you like to repeat it?

### [Sound?:](./index.html#L95) <br>
Would you like to have a sound?

### [Canvas?:](./index.html#L96) <br>
If you don't like seeing the changes in inspecting elements

# I just finished modifying in the [settings](./index.html#L91-L97). What now?

Open the html file in any browser. If you use Visual Studio Code, you can open it there too, with some extensions. For example [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server). Just open it in any app that support it. Even file explorer, if you press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> while selecting the
[`index.html`](./index.html) file.

# Result

The result is this sorting algorithm you just run.

# What happens the thingy's broken?
If you just broke the html file and you dont want to fix it:<br> just reinstall the thingy at [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/AlaTomKing/easy-sorting-algorithm-generator) (Only if you're not on GitHub). You may have to remodify your settings to your desired taste.

## Good sorting!
