You can change this file with my website JSONViewer. As for now, it's still on development

# I just finished modifying [`settings.json`](./settings.json). What now?
Open the html file in any browser. If you use Visual Studio Code, you can open it there too, with some extensions.

If you just broke the html file:<br> just reinstall the thingy at [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/AlaTomKing/easy-sorting-algorithm-generator) (Only if you're not on GitHub)
